# Breast-Cancer-Prediction-Project

#### This project was done during my HarvardX Data Science Certificate as a capstone to my Machine Learning course. In this project, I utilize breast cancer diagnosis biopsy samples for tumors that were benign or malignant to develop a machine learning model to predict malignant or benign tumors. There were 30 features in this model and a sample size of 569. PCA Analysis was conducted for practice, but its results not utilized. For further optimization, it would be ideal to utilize the results of those analysis. 

#### The data can be obtained from the 'dslabs' package in R and loading the dataset 'brca'.

#### I utilize the following ML models… 

* Log Regression

* Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)

* Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA)

* Loess Regression

* Random Forest

* K-Nearest Neighbors

* K-Means

#### Then, I also utilize the ensemble method by combining these models and selecting an output based on “majority rules”. The ensemble model developed an accuracy of 98.3% and within the models listed, the LDA model had the highest accuracy with 99.1%.

# Breast-Cancer-Prediction-Project

#### This project was done during my HarvardX Data Science Certificate as a capstone to my Machine Learning course. In this project, I utilize breast cancer diagnosis biopsy samples for tumors that were benign or malignant. I utilize the following ML models… 

* Log Regression

* Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)

* Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA)

* Loess Regression

* Random Forest

* K-Nearest Neighbors

* K-Means

#### Then, I also utilize the ensemble method by combining these models and selecting an output based on “majority rules”.
